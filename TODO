todo list:

- possible conflict with other modules loading codemirror,
  see  http://forum.wbce.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1169#p1169
  solution: implement some kind of namespace concept (see link in the
  thread) and a loader mechanism like in ckeditor and combine both
  to a framework which loads codemirror in a closed environment

- if you have more ideas for useful features feel free to let me know
