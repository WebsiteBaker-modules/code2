todo list:

- if there are long lines of code, and syntax highlighting is activated, there's neither a horizontal scrollbar nor a soft linewrap. Instead, the editor field is widened to the absolute maximum (I've a very long line and the editor field becomes 2821px width, idk where this value does come from)

- the content is stored as "text" in the database and hence cut off after 64k characters, should be changed to "longtext" to store also huge amounts of code?


- possible conflict with other modules loading codemirror,
  see  http://forum.wbce.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1169#p1169
  I'm not sure if this really is of any importance, but anyhow, possible
  solution: implement some kind of namespace concept (see link in the
  thread) and a loader mechanism like in ckeditor and combine both
  to a framework which loads codemirror in a closed environment

- if you have more ideas for useful features feel free to let me know
